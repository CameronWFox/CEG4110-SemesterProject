# CEG4110_SeeFoodApp_SemesterProject
The Semester Project for CEG 4110-01 at Wright State University

This is a team project where our team Group 7, is creating a mobile application for food identification through pictures. 
The application will be able to do the following:
1. Take a picture using the phone's camera
2. Sends the picture taken to an AWS server to test if the image is food
3. Hold all photos taken in a gallery to pick different pictures to send to the server
4. Remove the picture currently taken if the user wants to retake the picture
5. Recieve results from the server after sending the picture to see how much the picture resembles food

The interaction with the application is easily done through the use of a navigation drawer, with all the different views to 
connect to shown on screen.
